Problem 1
---------

The zip file that we are using in this problem is from a longitudinal study that has a control arm and an experimental arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the `list.files` function will help

``` r
data <- "/Users/jessiewong/Desktop/p8105_hw5/p8105_5/data/"
file_list <- list.files(path = data, pattern = "*.csv")

study <- 
  do.call("rbind",
          lapply(file_list,
                 function(x)
                   read.csv(paste(data, x, sep = ''),
                            stringsAsFactors = FALSE)))
```
